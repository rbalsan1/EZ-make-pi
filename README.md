# EZ-make-pi
This is a reworking of the Adafruit EZ-Make oven  example project designed to work on a SBC using circuit python and Blinka.  The code uses guizero and is designed for touch screen over HDMI and usb.
The original respository is here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/master/PyPortal_EZ_Make_Oven

This code is quite a bit different as it runs as a gui and the timeing is event based.

The code has only been teested on a Raspberry Pi model B Rev 2.
